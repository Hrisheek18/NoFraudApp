Fraud Detection API
This project is a Flask-based backend API that serves a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions. The model predicts whether a transaction is fraud or not and returns the fraud probability based on the input transaction data.

Overview
The API accepts JSON input with transaction features such as category, amount, gender, state, location coordinates, and other relevant details. It preprocesses these inputs using label encoders and scalers, then uses a pre-trained model to classify the transaction as fraudulent or legitimate.

Features
REST API endpoint /predict that accepts POST requests with transaction data.

Input validation to ensure all required features are present.

Preprocessing of categorical and numerical features.

Returns fraud prediction and probability as JSON.

Built using Flask and standard Python ML libraries.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

pip

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
Install required Python packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure the following files are present in the project folder:

best_model.pkl — trained ML model

scaler.pkl — scaler for numerical features

category_le.pkl — label encoder for category feature

state_le.pkl — label encoder for state feature

Running the API
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy
Edit
python <filename>.py
Replace <filename>.py with your backend script name (e.g., app.py).

The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Example Request
POST to /predict with JSON body containing all features:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "category": "some_category",
  "amt": 123.45,
  "gender": 1,
  "state": "some_state",
  "lat": 37.7749,
  "long": -122.4194,
  "city_pop": 1000000,
  "merch_lat": 37.7750,
  "merch_long": -122.4189,
  "hour": 15,
  "age": 30
}
Response example:
